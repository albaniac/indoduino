arduino indoor garden



what ive got so far... uses 2 moisture sensors and 2 pumps in conjunction with a relay board. also times a light, and will soon react to a dht11 temp/humidity sensor and a servo to control a vent.. also going to add fans at the vents. sends the system stats via serial when a byte is recieved.. shows soil status, pump status, and light status'.
